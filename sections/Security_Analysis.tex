\section{Security Analysis}

\subsection{Why RSA Digital Signatures Are Secure}

The security of RSA rests on the Integer Factorization Problem: given a large composite number $n = p \times q$, it is computationally infeasible to recover $p$ and $q$. Without knowing $p$ and $q$, an attacker cannot compute $\phi(n)$, and therefore cannot derive the private exponent $d$ from the public exponent $e$.

For our demonstration with small primes (e.g., $p = 104729$, $q = 224737$), the key size is approximately 34 bits—trivially factorable. In practice, RSA keys of 2048 bits or larger are used, where factorization would require billions of years with current technology.

\subsection{Hash Algorithm Comparison}

The choice of hash function directly impacts the security of the signature scheme:

        SHA-1              & 160                    & Weak            & First practical collision found (2017) \\
        SHA-256            & 256                    & Secure          & Industry standard, recommended         \\
        SHA-512            & 512                    & Secure          & Strongest output, higher margin        \\
        \hline
