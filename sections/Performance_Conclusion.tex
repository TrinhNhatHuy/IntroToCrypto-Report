\section{Conclusion}

This project successfully demonstrated the complete RSA digital signature lifecycle through a from-scratch Python implementation. The key findings are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authenticity:} Only the holder of the private key $d$ can produce a valid signature for a given message.
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity:} Any modification to the signed message is immediately detected through hash comparison, as demonstrated by the tampering attack simulation.
    \item \textbf{Non-repudiation:} The mathematical binding between the signature and the private key prevents the signer from denying their involvement.
\end{itemize}
